# Azure Arc Enabled Data Services

## Overview

### What is Azure Arc?

For customers who want to simplify complex and distributed environments across on-premises, edge, and multi-cloud, [Azure Arc](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/azure-arc/) enables deployment of Azure services anywhere and extends Azure management to any infrastructure.

  - Organize and govern across environments - Get sprawling Windows and Linux servers and Kubernetes clusters under control by centrally organizing and governing from Azure-across clouds, data centers, and edge.
  - Manage Kubernetes Apps at scale - Deploy and manage Kubernetes applications across environments using DevOps techniques. Ensure that applications are consistently deployed and configured at scale from source control.
  - Run Azure data services anywhere - Get the latest cloud innovation and automation, elastic scale, and unified management for data workloads that are running across hybrid infrastructure. Ensure consistency in data governance and security and manage costs efficiently.

### How Azure Arc Enabled Data Services add value?

With Azure Arc, you can now bring Azure data services to any infrastructure across on-premises data centers, edge and 3rd party clouds, using Kubernetes on hardware of your choice. For customers who need to maintain data estate onpremises, you will gain unique benefits for those on-premises data workloads.

**First**, you will always be current, meaning updates and upgrades are fully automated, and the deployment is controlled by your policy. You will gain unique and cloud proven innovation ahead of any other hybrid cloud offering like the evergreen SQL with no end-of-support through Azure SQL Database, and the hyperscale deployment option of Azure Database for PostgreSQL.

**Second**, we will bring cloud elasticity on-premises so you can optimize performance of data workloads with the ability to dynamically scale up/down and scale out, without application downtime.

Moreover, by connecting to Azure you will gain unified management. Imagine being able to see your data services running on-premises along side those running in Azure through a single pane of glass, using familiar tools like Azure Portal, Azure Data Studio and Azure CLI.

**Last** but not the least, you can get those benefits even if your environment does not have direct connection to Azure either due to network and security policies, or connection constraints, as long as you can set up a media to indirectly connect to Azure for telemetry data exchange and getting the latest container images. However, when you operate under an indirectly connected mode, you will not be able to fully leverage the unified management benefits such as using Azure Monitor, Azure Rolebased Access Control, and other value-added services from Azure.

## Hands-on Labs Scenario

The following labs provide you a quick and easy way to get started with Azure Arc through virtual environments that do not require any complex set-up or installations. For the purposes of these exercises, let’s consider Contoso, a large manufacturing organization. Their IT systems run Windows, Linux, Kubernetes, and SQL Servers across multiple locations, including on-premises data centers, distribution centers, and multiple public clouds. This poses operational challenges for Contoso. They’d like a consistent way to govern and operate across these disparate environments, ensure security across the entire organization, and enable innovation and developer agility (especially with their investments in cloud-native practices), all while meeting regulatory and compliance requirements.

## Lab Context

Leveraging Azure Arc enabled data services, Contoso is interested in implementing cloud-native, evergreen versions of SQL and PostgreSQL Hyperscale to reduce the management overhead and deploy their applications and databases anywhere with elastic scale.

Let’s take the journey together with Contoso and see how easy it is to accomplish all the above with Azure Arc.
